## Setting Up ROS2

Set locale

Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal like POSIX. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if youâ€™re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.

`locale  # check for UTF-8`

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales`

`sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8`

`sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8`

`export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`

`locale  # verify settings`

Setup Sources

You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repository to your system.

First ensure that the Ubuntu Universe repository is enabled.

`sudo apt install software-properties-common`

`sudo add-apt-repository universe`

Now add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y`

`sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg`

Then add the repository to your sources list.

`echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null`

Install ROS 2 packages

Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.

`sudo apt update`

ROS 2 packages are built on frequently updated Ubuntu systems. It is always recommended that you ensure your system is up to date before installing new packages.

`sudo apt upgrade`


Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.

`sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop`

Environment setup

Sourcing the setup script

Set up your environment by sourcing the following file.

Replace ".bash" with your shell if you're not using bash

Possible values are: setup.bash, setup.sh, setup.zsh

`source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`

Try some examples

Talker-listener

If you installed ros-humble-desktop above you can try some examples.

In one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++ talker:

`source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`

`ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker`

In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python listener:

`source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`

`ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener`
